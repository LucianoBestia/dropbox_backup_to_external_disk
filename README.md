On my Dropbox "remote drive" I have more than 1 Terabyte of data in 200 000 files.  
I own now 4 notebooks and 2 android phones and 1 tablet and not a single one has an internal drive with more than 1 Terabyte. I use dropbox `Selective Sync` to sync only the bare minimum I temporarily need on the local device. But I want to have a backup of all of my data. I must have a backup. Better, I want to have 2 backups of all the data on 2 external hard disks in different locations. So if Dropbox go bankrupt, I still have all my data.  
The original Dropbox Sync app works great for the internal HD, but is "not recommended" for external drives. I also need only one way sync: from remote to local. There exist apps for that:
- rclone
- dropbox_uploader

But I wanted to write something mine for fun, learning Rust and using my own apps.
I have a lot of files, so I wanted to list them first, then compare with the local files and finally download them. The delete part at the end will be "move to trash folder". So I can inspect what and how to delete it manually.  

## DropBox api2 - Stone sdk

Dropbox has made a `Stone` thing that contains all the API definition. From there is possible to generate code boilerplate for different languages for the api-client. 
For Rust there is this quasi official project:  
<https://crates.io/crates/dropbox-sdk>  

## Authorization OAuth2

Authorization on the internet is a mess. Dropbox api uses OAuth2.
Every app must have its own `app key` and `app secret`. 
For commercial programs they probably embed them into the binary code somehow. But for OpenSource projects it is not possible to keep a secret. So the workaround is: every user must create a new `dropbox app`. It will be private for him only. Creating a new app is medium simple:
- login to dropbox.com
- open App console <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps?_tk=pilot_lp&_ad=topbar4&_camp=myapps>
- Create app
- choose Scoped access
- choose Full dropbox
- choose a unique app name (it does not matter) ex. `dbx_files_20200916_181100`, write it somewhere safe
- Permission type, click Scoped App
- check `files.content.read` and `files.metadata.read`, Submit
- on the top return to the Settings tab
- App secret click Show, copy App key and App secret somewhere safe. This secret is like a password for your files. Be extra careful.
- Generated access token click Generate, copy somewhere safe.

This is it. You have a `quasi-private` dropbox app only for you. 
This is medium complicated solution because of OpenSource of the project where secrets cannot be shared.
This app will stay forever in `development status` in dropbox, to be more private and secure.

## Try it

You should be logged in Linux with your account. So things you do are (mostly) not visible to others.
In Linux bash before starting this app write the `access token` into this environment variable:
`$ export DBX_OAUTH_TOKEN=xx.xxxxx`
You can also skip this and give authorization with the interactive style.
You will need the `app key`, `app secret` and a browser.
Try the app like this:
`$ clear; cargo run --bin dbx_download -- test`
or
`$ clear; cargo build`
`$ alias dbx_download=target/debug/dbx_download`
`$ dbx_download test`
`$ unalias dbx_download`

## Development

Clone the repository:
<https://github.com/LucianoBestia/dbx_download>  

## dbx_download list_remote

List all the files from the remote Dropbox and saves to the file temp_data/list_remote_files.csv.
Tab delimited with metadata: path (with name), datetime modified, size.
The path is not really case-sensitive. They try to make it case-preserve, but this apply only to the last part of the path. Before that it is random.
For big dropbox remotes it can take a while to complete.
